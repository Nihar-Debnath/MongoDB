In MongoDB, a **"bucket"** is a concept used mainly in **time series collections** and **bucket-based aggregations** (such as `$bucket` and `$bucketAuto` in aggregation pipelines). It is **not a general-purpose storage unit like a table in SQL**, but a special way MongoDB organizes and processes data in certain contexts.

### üîπ 1. **Bucket in Time Series Collections**

MongoDB introduced **time series collections** in version **5.0** to efficiently store and query time-based data (like logs, sensor readings, stock prices, etc.).

#### ‚úÖ **What is a bucket in this context?**

* A **bucket** is an **internal grouping of time series documents**.
* MongoDB **groups multiple time series measurements** (documents) into a **single bucket document** for **storage efficiency and faster access**.
* Each bucket contains:

  * A **`min`** and **`max`** timestamp
  * The measurements as **arrays of field values**
  * Metadata (like sensor ID, location, etc.)

#### üß† Why buckets?

* Reduces the number of documents stored in the collection.
* Improves write performance and compression.
* Makes queries more efficient by scanning fewer documents.

#### üí° Example:

Imagine you insert multiple time-stamped temperature readings like this:

```js
{
  time: ISODate("2025-07-08T10:00:00Z"),
  sensorId: "sensor_1",
  temperature: 25.4
}
```

Behind the scenes, MongoDB will **group several of these readings** into one **bucket document**, like:

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId(...),
  control: {
    min: { time: ISODate("2025-07-08T10:00:00Z") },
    max: { time: ISODate("2025-07-08T10:05:00Z") }
  },
  data: {
    time: [ISODate(...), ISODate(...), ...],
    temperature: [25.4, 26.1, 24.8, ...]
  },
  meta: { sensorId: "sensor_1" }
}
```

You don‚Äôt access buckets directly ‚Äî MongoDB manages them internally.

---

### üîπ 2. **Bucket in Aggregation Framework**

MongoDB also uses the concept of buckets in the **aggregation framework**, especially in the `$bucket` and `$bucketAuto` stages. These are used to **group documents into categories (or "buckets")** based on a field value (usually numeric or date).

#### ‚úÖ `$bucket`: You manually define bucket boundaries.

```js
db.scores.aggregate([
  {
    $bucket: {
      groupBy: "$score",
      boundaries: [0, 50, 70, 90, 100],
      default: "Other",
      output: {
        count: { $sum: 1 },
        averageScore: { $avg: "$score" }
      }
    }
  }
])
```

‚û°Ô∏è This divides the documents into:

* 0‚Äì50
* 50‚Äì70
* 70‚Äì90
* 90‚Äì100
  Buckets are **explicitly defined**.

#### ‚úÖ `$bucketAuto`: MongoDB automatically creates N evenly distributed buckets.

```js
db.scores.aggregate([
  {
    $bucketAuto: {
      groupBy: "$score",
      buckets: 4,
      output: {
        count: { $sum: 1 },
        averageScore: { $avg: "$score" }
      }
    }
  }
])
```

‚û°Ô∏è MongoDB chooses the bucket ranges based on data distribution.

### üîç Summary Table

| Concept              | Context                 | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bucket (Storage)** | Time Series Collections | Internal storage optimization grouping multiple measurements |
| **\$bucket**         | Aggregation Pipeline    | Manually defined range grouping                              |
| **\$bucketAuto**     | Aggregation Pipeline    | Auto-distributed range grouping                              |

---

### üß† Final Notes:

* **You don‚Äôt create or manage buckets directly in time series collections**.
* In **aggregation**, buckets are used to group and analyze data more meaningfully.
* Buckets improve **performance and reduce storage** overhead.

We want to:

* Only include **male users**
* Group them into **age ranges** (buckets):

  * `<30`
  * `30‚Äì39`
  * `40+`


### ‚úÖ **1. Insert Many Users (With Age and Gender)**

We'll insert a bunch of sample users with `name`, `age`, and `gender`.

```js
db.users.insertMany([
  { name: "John", age: 25, gender: "male" },
  { name: "Mike", age: 31, gender: "male" },
  { name: "Robert", age: 45, gender: "male" },
  { name: "David", age: 38, gender: "male" },
  { name: "Chris", age: 29, gender: "male" },
  { name: "Andrew", age: 41, gender: "male" },
  { name: "Tom", age: 27, gender: "male" },
  { name: "Mark", age: 33, gender: "male" },
  { name: "Steve", age: 50, gender: "male" },
  { name: "Sarah", age: 28, gender: "female" },
  { name: "Emily", age: 35, gender: "female" },
  { name: "Rachel", age: 42, gender: "female" }
])
```

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Aggregation Pipeline with `$match` + `$bucket`**

We'll now filter only **male users** and group them into 3 **age-based buckets**:

* `< 30`
* `30 to <40`
* `>= 40`

```js
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { gender: "male" }
  },
  {
    $bucket: {
      groupBy: "$age", // field to bucket by
      boundaries: [0, 30, 40, 150], // bucket ranges
      default: "Other",
      output: {
        count: { $sum: 1 },
        users: { $push: "$name" }
      }
    }
  }
])
```

### ‚úÖ **Explanation:**

| Stage        | Purpose                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$match`     | Filters only male users                                    |
| `$bucket`    | Groups those users into age buckets: `<30`, `30‚Äì39`, `40+` |
| `groupBy`    | Uses `age` field to assign documents to buckets            |
| `boundaries` | Defines bucket edges: `[0,30)`, `[30,40)`, `[40,150)`      |
| `output`     | For each bucket, counts users and lists their names        |

  {
    _id: 0,
    count: 3,
    users: ["John", "Chris", "Tom"]
  },

    _id: 30,
    count: 3,
    users: ["Mike", "David", "Mark"]
  },
  {
    _id: 40,
    count: 3,
    users: ["Robert", "Andrew", "Steve"]
