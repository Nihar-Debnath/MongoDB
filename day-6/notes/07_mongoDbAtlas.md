# 🌐 What is **MongoDB Atlas**?

> **MongoDB Atlas** is the **official cloud-based version of MongoDB**, managed by MongoDB Inc.

It runs MongoDB databases on cloud platforms like:

* ✅ AWS
* ✅ Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* ✅ Microsoft Azure

So instead of installing MongoDB on your own machine or server, **Atlas hosts it for you online**.

# ❌ Disadvantages / Problems of Using MongoDB Atlas

### 1. 🌐 Internet Required

You **cannot use Atlas offline** — it requires a stable internet connection.

### 2. 💰 Pricing (for Production)

* Free tier is limited
* Paid plans can become costly at scale (storage, backups, data transfer)

> Example: If you run a high-traffic app, costs grow quickly with RAM, storage, and backup options.

### 3. 🔒 IP Whitelist Management

You must **add allowed IP addresses manually** for each developer or deploy server.

### 4. 🐢 Latency

If your users or app server is far from the Atlas data center, **read/write latency can increase**.

### 5. 🧰 Limited Customization

* You **can’t change server internals**
* No access to system logs or configs
