## üîç What is a **Text Index**?

A **text index** in MongoDB is a **special index type** that lets you perform **full-text search** on string content inside documents.

It enables queries like:

* Search for a **word or phrase** (`"developer"`, `"mongodb expert"`)
* Search for **multiple words** (like search engines)
* Search with **ranking (score)**

---

## ‚úÖ Why Use a Text Index?

Normally, to search a field you use:

```js
db.articles.find({ title: "MongoDB" })
```

But this only matches the **exact value** `"MongoDB"`.

To **search for a word** **inside a sentence**, like:

> "MongoDB is a great NoSQL database"

You need a **text index**, so MongoDB can **analyze and tokenize** (break into words) for full-text search.

---

## üß± Example Collection

```js
db.articles.insertMany([
  { title: "Introduction to MongoDB", content: "MongoDB is a NoSQL database" },
  { title: "Learning Node.js", content: "Node.js is great for backend" },
  { title: "Advanced MongoDB", content: "Indexes improve performance in MongoDB" }
])
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Create a Text Index

You can create a text index on **one** or **multiple string fields**.

```js
db.articles.createIndex({ content: "text" })
```

Or on multiple fields:

```js
db.articles.createIndex({ title: "text", content: "text" })
```

‚úÖ MongoDB will combine the fields and tokenize all the words.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Use `$text` in Queries

Now you can search:

```js
db.articles.find({ $text: { $search: "MongoDB" } })
```

It returns any document where `"MongoDB"` appears in the indexed fields.

You can even search **multiple words**:

```js
db.articles.find({ $text: { $search: "MongoDB Indexes" } })
```

It will return all documents containing **either** "MongoDB" **or** "Indexes".

---

## ‚ú® Use Phrase Search

You can wrap phrases in double quotes to search exact phrases:

```js
db.articles.find({ $text: { $search: "\"NoSQL database\"" } })
```

This only returns documents where **those words appear together** in that order.

---

## üî¢ Add Relevance Score

You can also sort by how **relevant** the result is:

```js
db.articles.find(
  { $text: { $search: "MongoDB" } },
  { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
).sort({ score: { $meta: "textScore" } })
```

üîπ This adds a `score` field to results
üîπ The higher the score ‚Üí the more relevant the match

---

## üí¨ Stop Words and Stemming

MongoDB text search automatically:

* Removes **stop words**: "is", "the", "and", etc.
* Applies **stemming**: So `"running"` matches `"run"`

This makes the search smarter.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

| Limitation                    | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One text index per collection | You can only have **one text index** (can include multiple fields though) |
| Case-insensitive              | Text search is **not case-sensitive**                                     |
| No regex                      | You can‚Äôt use regex in combination with `$text`                           |
| No partial word match         | Searching `"Mon"` won‚Äôt match `"MongoDB"` (use regex for that)            |

---

## üß† Check Indexes

```js
db.articles.getIndexes()
```

You‚Äôll see:

```json
{
  key: { _fts: "text", _ftsx: 1 },
  name: "title_text_content_text",
  weights: { title: 1, content: 1 }
}
```

---

## üß∞ Drop Text Index

```js
db.articles.dropIndex("title_text_content_text")
```

---

## üß™ Real Use Case

Let‚Äôs say you're building a **blog** or **forum**, and want to implement **search functionality** like:

> "Find all posts about MongoDB performance"

You create a text index on `title`, `content`, or `tags`, and then run:

```js
db.posts.find({ $text: { $search: "MongoDB performance" } })
```

‚úîÔ∏è Done! This is similar to Google-style search within your database.

### üìò Query Recap

```js
db.articles.find(
  { $text: { $search: "MongoDB" } },
  { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
).sort({ score: { $meta: "textScore" } })
```

---

### ‚ùì What Is This Doing?

This query:

1. **Performs a full-text search** for the word `"MongoDB"` in the indexed text fields (like `title`, `content`).
2. Adds a new field in the result called `score` that shows **how relevant** each document is to the search term.
3. **Sorts the results** by that score, so the **most relevant results come first**.

---

## üî¢ What Is a Text Score?

* The **`textScore`** is a **numerical value** MongoDB assigns to each matching document.
* It tells you **how well that document matched the search term**.
* The **higher the score**, the **better the match**.

---

### üß† How Is the Score Calculated?

MongoDB uses internal logic (similar to search engines):

| Factor                   | Explanation                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Term frequency**       | If `"MongoDB"` appears many times in a document ‚Üí higher score                   |
| **Field weights**        | Fields like `title` may be more important than `content` (if you assign weights) |
| **Word position**        | Earlier occurrences may be scored higher                                         |
| **Exact vs loose match** | Phrase matches or full word matches get better scores                            |

So a document with `"MongoDB"` mentioned 5 times in the title will get a higher score than one that only mentions it once in the content.

---

## üß™ Example Output

Assume this query:

```js
db.articles.find(
  { $text: { $search: "MongoDB" } },
  { score: { $meta: "textScore" }, title: 1, content: 1, _id: 0 }
).sort({ score: { $meta: "textScore" } })
```

Might return:

```js
{
  title: "Advanced MongoDB Indexes",
  content: "Indexes improve MongoDB performance.",
  score: 2.8
},
{
  title: "MongoDB Overview",
  content: "MongoDB is a NoSQL database.",
  score: 1.9
},
{
  title: "Learning Databases",
  content: "SQL and NoSQL databases are different.",
  score: 0.3
}
```

Notice:

* All three matched the search somehow.
* But the one most **focused** on MongoDB came first.

---

## ‚úÖ Why Use This?

This is extremely useful when you want to:

* Implement a **search bar** that returns results **sorted by relevance**
* Highlight **top-matching articles/products/questions**
* Combine it with **pagination** for a search engine feel

---

## üõ† Optional: Adjusting Weights

You can **customize** what matters more by assigning weights when creating the index:

```js
db.articles.createIndex(
  { title: "text", content: "text" },
  { weights: { title: 5, content: 1 } }
)
```

Now matches in `title` will have **5x higher influence** on score than matches in `content`.

## üîÅ TL;DR Summary

| Term                                       | Meaning                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `$meta: "textScore"`                       | Tells MongoDB to **calculate and return relevance**  |
| `score` field                              | Shows **how closely** a document matches the search  |
| `.sort({ score: { $meta: "textScore" } })` | Sorts results so **most relevant ones appear first** |
| You can customize weights                  | To prioritize certain fields over others             |


---
---
---


## üõí Scenario: You Run a Product Website (Like Flipkart or Amazon)

You have a collection called `products`:

```js
db.products.insertMany([
  {
    name: "MongoDB Book",
    description: "Learn how to use MongoDB for web development."
  },
  {
    name: "Database Design Book",
    description: "Covers SQL and NoSQL databases including MongoDB."
  },
  {
    name: "Node.js Guide",
    description: "Build fast servers using Node.js and Express."
  },
  {
    name: "Notebook",
    description: "A spiral-bound notebook for school or work."
  }
])
```

---

## ‚ùì Now You Want to Build a Search Feature

User types into your search bar:

```
mongodb
```

You want to show the **most relevant products first**, not just **any product that mentions "MongoDB" somewhere.**

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Create a Text Index

```js
db.products.createIndex({ name: "text", description: "text" })
```

MongoDB now indexes all **words** in both fields and can search them efficiently.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Search Using `$text` and Include Score

```js
db.products.find(
  { $text: { $search: "mongodb" } },
  { score: { $meta: "textScore" }, name: 1, description: 1, _id: 0 }
).sort({ score: { $meta: "textScore" } })
```

---

## üîç What MongoDB Will Do

It will:

1. Search for the word `"mongodb"` in `name` and `description`
2. Assign a **relevance score** to each matching document
3. Return results **sorted by score**

---

## üî¢ Sample Output

```js
[
  {
    name: "MongoDB Book",
    description: "Learn how to use MongoDB for web development.",
    score: 3.5
  },
  {
    name: "Database Design Book",
    description: "Covers SQL and NoSQL databases including MongoDB.",
    score: 2.2
  }
]
```

‚û°Ô∏è Why is `"MongoDB Book"` first?

* Because **"MongoDB" appears in the title**, and the whole description is about MongoDB
* It‚Äôs **more focused**, so it‚Äôs **more relevant**

---

## üß† Why Do We Need the `score`?

Without the `score`, both documents would appear with **no way to know which is better**.

Imagine you're a user:

* You search for "MongoDB"
* And the first result is "Database Design Book"
* But the **better result** ‚Äî "MongoDB Book" ‚Äî is listed second

‚ùå That‚Äôs bad for user experience!

‚úÖ Using `score` lets you **show the best results first**, just like Google.

---

## üîß With `.sort({ score })`, You're Saying:

> "Hey MongoDB, not just match documents ‚Äî tell me **how well they match** and show the best ones on top."

---

## ‚úÖ When Should You Use Text Score?

Use it when:

| Situation                               | Use `textScore`? |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Search bar for blogs, products, users   | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| Relevance-based ranking is important    | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| Exact match isn't enough                | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| You just want to check if a word exists | ‚ùå Not needed     |

---

## üß≠ Final Summary

| Feature                  | Why It Matters                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `text` index             | Lets you search inside string fields |
| `$text: { $search: "" }` | Runs a full-text search              |
| `$meta: "textScore"`     | Tells MongoDB to rank results        |
| `.sort({ score })`       | Shows the best matches at the top    |
