In **MongoDB**, a **COLLSCAN** (short for **collection scan**) is a type of query execution where the database **scans every document in a collection** to find matching results.

### 🔍 What it means:

* MongoDB **does not use an index** for the query.
* It **checks each document one by one**, which can be **slow** for large collections.

### 📉 Example:

```js
db.users.find({ age: 25 })
```

If there is **no index on `age`**, MongoDB performs a **COLLSCAN**.

### ❌ Disadvantages:

* **Slow** on large datasets.
* **High CPU and I/O usage**.

---


In **MongoDB**, an **IXSCAN** (short for **Index Scan**) is a type of query execution where MongoDB **uses an index** to quickly locate the matching documents, instead of scanning the entire collection.

---

### ✅ **What it means:**

MongoDB searches **only the indexed fields**, which makes queries **much faster and more efficient** than COLLSCAN.

---

### 📘 Example:

```js
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 })  // Create an index on 'age'
db.users.find({ age: 25 })        // MongoDB uses IXSCAN
```

Now, MongoDB **scans only the index**, not the full collection.

---

### ⚡ **Benefits of IXSCAN:**

* **Faster queries**, especially on large collections.
* **Lower CPU and memory** usage.
* Can improve performance of **filtering**, **sorting**, and **range queries**.

---

### 🔍 Visual Summary:

| Query Type | Uses Index? | Speed (Large Data) | Execution Name  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| COLLSCAN   | ❌ No        | 🐢 Slow            | Collection Scan |
| IXSCAN     | ✅ Yes       | ⚡ Fast             | Index Scan      |

Use **IXSCAN** by creating indexes on the fields you're querying or sorting frequently.

In **MongoDB**, an **index** is **not exactly** the same as a **primary key**, but they are related.

Let me explain clearly:

---

### 🔑 What is an **Index**?

An **index** is a **data structure** that MongoDB uses to **quickly find documents** that match a query condition — **without scanning the whole collection**.

Think of it like the **index in a book** — it helps you jump directly to the page you need instead of reading every page.

---

### 📌 Is Index the Same as Primary Key?

| Feature                    | Primary Key (`_id`)            | Index                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Is it an index?**        | ✅ Yes (always indexed)         | ✅ Yes (manually or automatically created) |
| **Unique?**                | ✅ Always unique                | 🔁 Can be unique or not                   |
| **Automatically created?** | ✅ Yes for `_id`                | ❌ No (you create other indexes manually)  |
| **Purpose**                | Uniquely identifies a document | Speeds up search/filter/sort              |

---

### ✅ Example:

```js
// By default, every document has an _id field which is a unique index
{ _id: ObjectId("..."), name: "Alice", age: 23 }

// You can create additional indexes
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 })     // Regular index on 'age'
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 }, { unique: true }) // Unique index on 'email'
```



---

> in every collections and every document there are for one entity we manually creates index, it not automatically created like _id



Exactly! You're right — let me explain it **clearly and simply**:

---

### ✅ In MongoDB:

#### 🔹 `_id` Field:

* Every **document** in **every collection** automatically has an `_id` field.
* It is the **primary key**.
* MongoDB automatically creates a **unique index** on `_id`.
* You **do NOT need to create it manually**.

```json
{ "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Alice", "age": 25 }
```

---

### ❗ Other Fields (like `name`, `age`, `email`, etc.):

* **Indexes are NOT created automatically.**
* If you want MongoDB to search faster using these fields, you must **manually create an index**.

---

### 🧪 Example:

#### 👇 This collection:

```json
{ "_id": ..., "name": "Alice", "age": 25 }
{ "_id": ..., "name": "Bob", "age": 30 }
```

#### 👉 If you run:

```js
db.users.find({ age: 25 })
```

MongoDB will:

* Do a **COLLSCAN** (scan every document) ❌ SLOW

#### ✅ But if you create an index:

```js
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 })
```

MongoDB will:

* Use **IXSCAN** (search using index) ✅ FAST

---

### 📌 Summary

| Field Type      | Indexed Automatically? | Unique?    | Manually Created? |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| `_id`           | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No              |
| Any other field | ❌ No                   | ❌ Optional | ✅ Yes (if needed) |

So yes — **you must manually create indexes** on other fields (like `name`, `email`, etc.) **only if** you need faster search, sort, or filtering.

> okay so collscan uses wholke document search, but ho does index searches it? like index also need to compare with all the documents na?

Awesome question! You're thinking in the right direction — let me explain how **indexes actually work under the hood** in MongoDB, and **why they are faster** than COLLSCAN.

---

### 🤔 Why indexes are faster — does it still check all documents?

**No, it does NOT compare all documents.** Here's how:

---

### 📚 Imagine a Library Example:

* **COLLSCAN** = You check **every book on every shelf** to find one with “Harry Potter”.
* **IXSCAN** = There is a **sorted list (index)** that tells you **exactly where** “Harry Potter” is — no need to check all books.

---

### 🔧 How MongoDB Index Works Internally:

1. MongoDB creates a **special data structure** called a **B-tree** (balanced tree) when you create an index.
2. The B-tree:

   * Stores **key-value pairs**: e.g., `{ age: 25, pointer_to_document }`
   * Keeps keys in **sorted order**
   * Allows **binary search**, so lookup time is **O(log n)** (much faster than O(n))

---

### 🧪 Example:

Suppose you have 1 million documents like this:

```json
{ name: "Alice", age: 25 }
{ name: "Bob", age: 30 }
...
```

You create an index:

```js
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 })
```

Now MongoDB stores a separate **index table** like:

| `age` | Pointer to Document |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| 18    | → Doc 1             |
| 20    | → Doc 2             |
| 25    | → Doc 5             |
| 30    | → Doc 9             |

So when you query:

```js
db.users.find({ age: 25 })
```

MongoDB:

* Looks in the **index**, finds `25`, and directly jumps to the document(s).
* **Skips all unrelated documents**.

---

### 📌 Summary:

| Type     | Compares Every Document? | Uses B-tree Index? | Speed             |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| COLLSCAN | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No               | 🐢 Slow (O(n))    |
| IXSCAN   | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes              | ⚡ Fast (O(log n)) |
