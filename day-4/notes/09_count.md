### 🧱 Your Aggregation Pipeline:

```js
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      gender: "male"
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$age",
      sameAge: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  }
])
```

---

### 🧠 What happens here:

#### 1. `$match: { gender: "male" }`

This **filters** the documents to only include those where `gender` is `"male"` — like a `WHERE` clause in SQL.

So from a collection like:

```js
{ name: "Alice", gender: "female", age: 25 }
{ name: "Bob", gender: "male", age: 25 }
{ name: "Tom", gender: "male", age: 30 }
{ name: "Jerry", gender: "male", age: 25 }
```

Only these pass through to the next stage:

```js
{ name: "Bob", gender: "male", age: 25 }
{ name: "Tom", gender: "male", age: 30 }
{ name: "Jerry", gender: "male", age: 25 }
```

---

#### 2. `$group: { _id: "$age", sameAge: { $sum: 1 } }`

This groups the matched documents by their `age`.

* `_id: "$age"` → group by age
* `sameAge: { $sum: 1 }` → count how many males are in each age group

---

### ✅ Final Output:

```js
[
  { _id: 25, sameAge: 2 },  // 2 males aged 25
  { _id: 30, sameAge: 1 }   // 1 male aged 30
]
```

| Stage    | Purpose                                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$match` | Filter documents (gender = "male")                       |
| `$group` | Group filtered docs by `age`, count them using `$sum: 1` |

### 🧱 Aggregation Pipeline:

    }

      maxAge: { $max: "$sameAge" }
    }
  }
])
```

---

### 🔍 What is happening at each stage?

---

#### **1. `$match: { gender: "male" }`**

✔️ Filters the documents — keeps only those where `gender` is `"male"`.

---

#### **2. `$group: { _id: "$age", sameAge: { $sum: 1 } }`**

✔️ Groups the male users by `age`, and counts how many users are in each age group.

Output after this stage (for example):

```js
[
  { _id: 25, sameAge: 4 },
  { _id: 30, sameAge: 2 },
  { _id: 28, sameAge: 5 }
]
```

---

#### **3. `$sort: { sameAge: -1 }`**

✔️ Sorts these age groups in **descending order** of `sameAge` (i.e., most common age group first).

Result:

```js
[
  { _id: 28, sameAge: 5 },
  { _id: 25, sameAge: 4 },
  { _id: 30, sameAge: 2 }
]
```

---

#### **4. `$group: { _id: null, maxAge: { $max: "$sameAge" } }`**

✔️ This groups all the sorted results into a **single group** (since `_id: null`) and finds the **maximum value of `sameAge`** across all age groups.

Output:

```js
{ _id: null, maxAge: 5 }
```

---

### ✅ Final Result

You get:

```js
{ _id: null, maxAge: 5 }
```

This tells you:

> The age group with the most **male users** has **5 people** in it.

| Stage          | Purpose                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `$match`       | Filter male users                       |
| `$group`       | Count how many males per age            |
| `$sort`        | Sort by count descending                |
| `$group` again | Find the max count among all age groups |
